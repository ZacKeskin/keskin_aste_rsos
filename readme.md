## Instructions to reproduce plots

### Requirements
- The plots in the submission were produced using Python's Matplotlib plotting library
- Causality code was developed by the author and the source is available at https://github.com/ZacKeskin/PyCausality
- The plots were produced using Python 3.8.1. Other versions are likely to work but this is not guaranteed.
- To install the required packages, in your terminal `cd` to this (root) directory containing this readme file and run the command:
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Code
- From this (root) directory, having installed the prerequisite packages, you can run the files in \code using simply:

`python code/Figure1.py`

or

`python code/Figure2.py`

etc.

If using anaconda on MacOS, and the above does not work, replacing python with pythonw in the command should help, e.g.:

`pythonw code/Figure2.py`
